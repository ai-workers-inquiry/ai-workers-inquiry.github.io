<h2 id="session-description">Session Description</h2>

<p>AI’s impact on the labor process raises new questions about control, autonomy, and resistance. The goal of our workshop is to identify concrete possibilities for labor resistance by examining, with our participants and panelists, how AI technologies restructure work (and management), intensify exploitation, and shift the dynamics of control in everyday workplaces.</p>

<p>This workshop will begin with a panel discussion exploring the various ways in which AI has changed the labor process—from algorithmic management and surveillance to automation and alienation. The panelists, which will include rank-and-file workers, organizers, and labor experts, will draw from their own experiences to highlight examples of how workers have organized to resist AI in the workplace and AI-empowered management practices. Through contracts and bargaining fights, worker-led mutual aid efforts, grievances and unfair labor practice (ULP) charges, and a variety of other methods, workers can contest the harms of AI alongside other workplace issues including compensation, working schedules, and technologies of surveillance and management.</p>

<p>In the second part of our workshop, we will translate insights and strategies from the panel conversation to participants’ own workplace conditions through our AI Workers’ Inquiry exercise. We follow <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/04/20.htm">Marx’s 1880 “workers’ inquiry”</a> – a set of questions about workers’ working conditions, experiences of exploitation, their role in the value-production process, and the opportunities for collective response through workers’ councils and strikes. Marx’s survey has subsequently been a point of inspiration for workers to facilitate collective sense-making about their conditions as well as to perform the spadework for resistance and ways to build power in their own workplaces.</p>

<h2 id="schedule">Schedule</h2>

<p>The workshop will be held on Monday, June 23, 2025 from <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=FAccT+2025+CRAFT+-+AI+Workers%27+Inquiry+&amp;iso=20250623T1615&amp;p1=26&amp;ah=2&amp;am=15">4:15 PM – 6:30 PM UTC+3</a>.
